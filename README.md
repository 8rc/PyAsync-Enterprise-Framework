# PyAsync Enterprise Framework

- Overview
    PyAsync Enterprise Framework is a robust, scalable asynchronous application framework designed for building high-performance, maintainable Python applications. It combines modern Python features with enterprise-grade patterns and practices to provide a comprehensive solution for building resilient distributed systems.

- Key Features
    -   1. Asynchronous Operations
            -   Built on Python's asyncio for non-blocking I/O operations
            -   Efficient handling of concurrent tasks and operations
            -   Support for both async and sync function integration

    -   2. Enterprise Design Patterns
            -   Circuit Breaker Pattern: Prevents cascading failures in distributed systems
                -   Configurable failure thresholds and reset timeouts
                -   Three states: CLOSED, OPEN, and HALF-OPEN
                -   Automatic failure detection and recovery

            -   Observable Pattern: Advanced event handling and monitoring
                -   Thread-safe event propagation
                -   Event history tracking
                -   Asynchronous observer notifications
                -   Configurable event retention

            -   Resource Management: Efficient resource handling
                -   Thread pool management
                -   Resource limiting and cleanup
                -   Automatic resource disposal
                -   Configurable pool sizes

    -   3. Performance Optimization
            -   Memoization System: Smart caching implementation
                -   Time-based cache invalidation (TTL)
                -   Size-limited cache with LRU eviction
                -   Thread-safe operations
                -   Memory leak prevention

    -   4. Monitoring and Metrics
            -   Comprehensive Metric Collection:
                -   Performance tracking
                -   Error rate monitoring
                -   Resource usage statistics
                -   Custom metric support

            -   System Analysis:
                -   Method-level performance tracking
                -   Error tracking and logging
                -   Automated performance reporting

    -   5. Task Management
            -   Context Management:
                -   Automatic resource cleanup
                -   Error handling and logging
                -   Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
                -   Timeout management

# Usage Examples

- Basic Usage
    ```py
    async def main():
        # Initialize resource manager
        resource_manager = AsyncResourceManager()

        # Create a data processor
        class DataProcessor(Observable, SystemAnalyzer):
            @monitored
            async def process_data(self, data: list) -> None:
                await self.notify("Processing started", data)
                # Processing logic here
                await self.notify("Processing completed", len(data))

        # Set up observers
        processor = DataProcessor()
        async def log_observer(event_type: str, *args: Any):
            logging.info(f"Event: {event_type}, Args: {args}")

        processor.attach(log_observer)

        # Process data
        await processor.process_data([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    ```

- Circuit Breaker Implementation
    ```py
    class ServiceCall:
        @CircuitBreaker(failure_threshold=5, reset_timeout=60)
        async def make_request(self):
            # Remote service call logic
            pass
    ```

- Memoized Function
    ```py
    class DataService:
        @Memoized(ttl=3600, max_size=1000)
        async def fetch_data(self, key: str) -> dict:
            # Data fetching logic
            pass
    ```

# Requirements

    Python 3.8+
    asyncio
    logging
    typing support

# Information
    The PyAsync Enterprise Framework provides a solid foundation for building robust, scalable, and maintainable asynchronous applications in Python. Its combination of enterprise patterns, performance optimization, and comprehensive monitoring makes it suitable for both small projects and large-scale enterprise applications.
